Predicting inhibitory response of estrogen receptor modulators using Graph convolutional networks trained on censored data.

## Background

Bioactivity assays are typically performed over a limited range of compound concentrations, IC50 or EC50 values may be reported as being above or below a maximum or minimum concentration, so that the measurements are censored.
